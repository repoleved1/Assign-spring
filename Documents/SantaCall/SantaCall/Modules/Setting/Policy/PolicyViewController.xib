Information Collection and Use

About the face data collecting: We do not collect any face data or user photos. My app provides functionality for users to create a funny sticker from their faces. Users can stitch faces into our drawings to create a fun sticker. Users can then share or use them in iMessage. We do not save this data on the server or send it to any 3rd party.

For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.
